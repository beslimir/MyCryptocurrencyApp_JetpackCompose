# MyCryptocurrencyApp_JetpackCompose

The purpose of this project is to create a clean architecture app with Jetpack Compose.
As this is my first app with Jetpack Compose, I wanted to use some stuff already known, like:

- Retrofit
- Dagger Hilt
- Coroutines
- MVVM architecture
- Use cases (domain layer)

and create the UI interface in

- Jetpack Compose

Info: in development branch I moved some logic from use case to repository.
